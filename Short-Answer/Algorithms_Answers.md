#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
    I believe this is either O(n^3) due to the n^3  condition in the while loop, otherwise it would simply be O(n) as it would increase linearly with input size.

b)
    I think this is O(n^2) due to two for loops, however, given the multiplicate operator, I'm not sure if this offsets what would otherwise be a power of 2 increase in time.

c)
    This is simply O(n) as the number of operations will increase linearly with input size with a simple recursion loop.

## Exercise II


Determine the 'middle floor' of n-story building, and drop an egg. 
    If the egg breaks, determine the 'middle floor' of n-story building up to the current floor and repeat. 
    If the egg does not break, determine the 'middle floor of n-story building up to the top floor and repeat.
